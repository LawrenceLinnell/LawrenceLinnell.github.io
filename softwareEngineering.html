									<h1>Software Design & Engineering</h1>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;To showcase my ability to enhance the applications functionality and improve the user
										    experience I designed and implemented a direct search algorithm for a given cruise
										    ship, passenger, or active cruise.  If the given information is not in the system,
										    then a “Not in database” message will display on the terminal.  This functionality
										    directly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the application to quickly
										    report information within the database without the need for the user to manually
										    search for information.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Other improvements to the application include renaming Driver.java to LuxuryCruiseLine.Java
										    making it a more meaningful description of the program as well as reducing the length of the
										    main driver class by creating four new classes: ShipList.java, CruisList.java,
										    PassengerList.java and ValidInput.java.  Methods from the driver class were moved to one
										    of these new classes based on their respective functionality making the code more reusable,
										    easier to read and debug if necessary.  Comments were added to explain each class and
										    method.  All indentation was updated to ensure uniformity.  All variables were converted
										    to camel case as well as given more meaningful names.  These enhancements help to
										    showcase my ability to upgrade legacy code to modern coding standards and improve
										    code reusability.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;With these enhancements I was able to meet the course objectives as planned in module one.
										    However, after further inspection, I have also decided to enhance this application further
											by implementing file input and output.  This enhancement will allow the user to update and
											store data to the local file system.  At this time, the application relies on hard coded
											data to operate but will accept new input.  Any new input added will be erased upon exiting
											the application which does not provide much value to the user.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;One issue I ran into while enhancing the Luxury Cruise Line
										    application to expand its functionality with a direct search feature was using the compareTo()
										    function within the for loop conditional statement.  I received an error that an integer could
										    not be converted to a Boolean.  The mistake that I was making was that I was only comparing
										    the strings which returns a -1, 0 or 1 depending whether the strings were less than, equal
											or greater then each other in terms of their lexicographic order.  To resolve this, the
										    conditional statement was adjusted to compare the return value of the string comparison
										    to zero.  This would then return either a true if the strings were the same or a false 
										    if they were different.</pstyle>
								    <p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Another issue I discovered while enhancing the application was
										    that it is not always that easy to find a class for new code.  For instance, the switch statement
										    that handles the processing of the menu option for the direct search feature contains a nested
										    switch statement to handle the user input based on what they are searching for.  Since this
										    functionality was directly related to menu processing, I decided to leave this code within
										    the switch statement.  However, the functionality that is associated to searching for a cruise,
										    ship or passenger was implemented within their respective classes.</pstyle>
