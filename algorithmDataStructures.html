									<h1>Algorithms & Data Structures</h1>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;To showcase my ability and understanding of algorithms and data
										structures I developed a quicksort algorithm which sorts the objects in a Java ArrayList
										lexicographically based on the objects shipName attribute.  When a user chose to display
										ship names to the screen a list would be populated but would not be sorted.  This is fine
										for a small database of names but makes it very difficult for the user to find a ship in
										the system if the database grows larger.  The quicksort algorithm was chosen based on
										its proven reliability and performance with an average time complexity of O (n log n).</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;The quicksort algorithm that I designed and implemented
										illustrates my ability to choose an algorithm that is efficient while also considering
										system resources.  This algorithm also showcases my ability to access object attributes
										and use that information within conditional logic statements to perform an in-place sort.
										The implementation also helps to showcase that I am capable of taking commonly understood
										algorithms, customizing them and extending their functionality for proprietary software.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;I did meet the course objectives that I planned to meet.
										Further functionality that I plan to implement is to extend the quicksort algorithm to
										sort other custom data types.  In this program it solely sorts the shipList ArrayList
										of Ship objects. I am considering either implementing an opaque pointer in the quicksort
										algorithm to minimize on method overloading or potentially create a new template class
										that the other objects inherit abstract methods from with similar method call names
										and then update the quicksort method to be more generic to accept these additional
										data types.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;While enhancing this artifact I have refreshed my
										memory and skills when using the Eclipse debugger.  I ran into a buffer overflow
										problem which set me back quite a bit because I was very rusty with Eclipseâ€™s debugger.
										After reviewing some resources on the internet, I was able to isolate the error.
										It was somewhat time consuming trying to find a good instructional source to learn
										how to use Eclipses debugger due to a lack of tutorials with clearly spoken English.</pstyle>
								    <p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;This was a good exercise for me to revisit recursion
										and divide and conquer sorting algorithms.  I plan to review the algorithms and data
										structures that I have studied in the past.  A lot of my previous work with
										algorithms and data structures is written in C, so I also had to learn some
										new syntax to implement a Java version of quicksort.  Overall, I thought the
										Java version is much easier to code and interpret.</pstyle>
