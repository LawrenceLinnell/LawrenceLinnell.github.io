									<h1>Professional Self Assessment</h1>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;I have been part of SNHU’s Computer Science program for nearly
										two years.  I graduated with High Honors from Northern Essex Community College in May of 2019
										with an Associate in Science: Computer Information Sciences.  After some research I discovered SNHU’s online Computer Science program
										and immediately transferred because it allowed me the flexibility to complete my degree
										online without the need to travel daily.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;There are so many invaluable concepts and skills that I have
										learned which makes it nearly impossible to choose the most significant.  These concepts range
									    from organizing and communicating application development ideas utilizing flow charts and
									    pseudocode, the ability to read and write in numerous programming languages such as C, C++,
										Java, and Python, the ability to debug software for logic issues as well as compile time,
										runtime and memory leaks.  I also have gained invaluable knowledge about various data
										structures and algorithms such as hash tables, binary trees, dictionaries, and my favorite;
										AVL trees.  The list could go on and on.  I also value the foundational knowledge to be
										able to work in distributed group environments using GIT, as well as the ability to work
										in an AGILE environment to be able to continuously deliver high quality applications and
										be able to change development focus to suit the customers’ needs as efficiently as
										possible.  This only scratches the surface of the software development side of Computer
										Science and is no way comprehensive.  Software development has always been my passion,
										and this is the direction that I plan to take my career.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Obtaining a bachelor’s in computer science at SNHU is a major
										milestone on my career path as a software engineer that will open many doors along the way.
									    SNHU’s online computer science program is unique in its own way because it requires a great
										deal of dedication, responsibility, and self-starter qualities.  I put every effort into
									    this class to build an electronic portfolio that highlights the knowledge and skillset that
										are required of a software developer to improve my odds of obtaining a position with a
									    reputable company.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;The artifacts that follow this self-assessment include a
										peer code review which explains the enhancements that will be done in three areas of development.
										The three areas of enhancement are software engineering, algorithms & data structures,
										and databases.  Enhancements in these three areas helps showcase the skillset that I have
										developed through my college career which supports a career in software engineering.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;The skills that I plan to illustrate with the code review include
										the ability to communicate functionality of the code while also providing deeper explanations
										for various functions and algorithms as needed.  The skills illustrated within the narratives
										will not only reinforce my capability of understanding the code implementation but will also
										showcase my ability to write clear, concise, and easy to interpret code.  I plan to do this
										by clearly describing each given artifact, justifying its purpose, and reflecting upon the
										process of enhancing it within the scope of the knowledge attained.  I also plan to discuss
										the various challenges met and how they were resolved.  </pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;I will illustrate my software engineering skillset by enhancing
										the final project of IT-145 Fundamentals of Application Development.  This is a Java application
										designed for a cruise line company to track passengers, cruise ships and active cruises.  A menu
										is displayed to the user which allows for adding, editing, and viewing of cruise ships,
										passengers, and active cruises.  Currently when the user chooses to query the system for
										cruise ships, passengers or cruises, the output is random and in no particular order.  This
										is fine for a small company but in a larger company this would be difficult to find exact
										information.  I plan to enhance this application by adding a direct search.  This
										enhancement directly affects operational efficiency allowing the user to focus on
										other tasks such as building close and harmonious relationships with customers and
										clients.  Furthermore, I will implement input verification to enhance the security
										of the application.  Currently there is no verification for input.  This additional
										enhancement correlates directly with CS-499-05 to illustrate a security mindset
										that “anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to
										expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and
										enhanced security of data and resources”.</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;To exemplify my ability for algorithm and data structures
									    knowledge I will enhance the same cruise ship program as specified within the previous
										section which is derived from the final project of IT-145.  As mentioned previously,
										when a user requests passenger, cruise ship or cruise data the returned data is returned
										in random output.  To enhance this feature, I plan to implement a quicksort algorithm
										that will output the data in alphabetical order to make it easier for the operator
										to discern.  The quicksort algorithm is chosen based on an average linear time
										complexity, ease of implementation and proven stability.  The outcome of this
										enhancement will directly satisfy CS-499-03 in my ability to “Design and evaluate
										computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and
										computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while
										managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.”</pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;To showcase my knowledge of database design and
										implementation I will enhance the final project “Rest.py” from CS-340 Advanced Programming
										which is based on a client server model utilizing MongoDB and implementing Restful
										services.  This program is written in Python and queries a Mongo database using SQL
										to retrieve stock market information.  This will also help to highlight my knowledge
										of the Python language.  The enhancement that I plan to facilitate involves
										expanding the restful API that I designed in Python to include more advanced SQL
										commands for aggregating a list of the top ten performing stocks from the database.
										The completion of this enhancement shall satisfy CS-499-02, CS-499-04, and CS-499-05.
										The code will be implemented with a security mindset by ensuring data input is
										verified along with demonstrating my ability to use innovative techniques to
										implement solutions that are appropriately adapted to the user (specific audience). </pstyle>
									<p style="text-align:justify">&emsp;Overall, these illustrations will support my professional
										self-assessment which will reflect upon my capstone project and experience gained within
										the Computer Science program at SNHU.  I will do this by focusing on my strengths within
										computer science that directly reflect my ability to design and implement professional
										software solutions that are efficient, secure and portray a professional level of
										functionality.</pstyle>
